# PostScriptML 
## A Machine Learning based rating tool for selecting your most ideal raw images so you don't have to. 

## Created by Dolci Key 


## Background 

Having come from a background of both photography and fashion, I have spent a considerable amount of time both behind and infront of the camera. My grandfather was a photography professor and I grew up with a film camera in hand. My grandad was one of the first of his generation to embrace the digital age in photography and started experimenting with digital images when I was in high school. He often looked through my images, critiquing the framing or sometimes prasing the balance of the image or sharp focus. In film photography, image selection happened after film was developed, but in the digital age, after images are downloaded, images go through a process called selection, sometimes even multiple rounds of selection before final images are choses, edited, and exported. This process can take hours and is a pain-staking process, or was. Until now. 

The idea behind this model is that once trained with a vast amount of knowlege to intepret and analyze photography, this Convelutional Neural Network will be able to take a set of raw (.NEF) images before editing and select the images having a probability of idealness of 90% or above. Once selected, you can take those images and directly start editing. Saving hours, time, and money. 


### Shoot > Download images > Selection Process > Edit Images > Export Final Images

During the post shoot processing,  after images are downloaded, many photographers spend hours sorting through hundreds or thousands of images during the selection process. Other photographers have assistants or interns sort through these images. PostScriptML aims to minimize time sorting through images using a convelutional neural network to filter images and return back images that meet a certain criteria.

I would like to further expand this model into an app and also eventually work towards building software that can be integrated into a camera for real time analysis.
